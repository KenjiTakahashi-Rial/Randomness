# Randomness

Let's face it, humans are no good at being random. We create patterns, follow routines, and even when we try to be as random as possible, our predictability is inescapable (this website does a great job at explaining the details and has more links if you are interested https://www.expunctis.com/2019/03/07/Not-so-random.html).

Enter Randomness. A simple app to just do random things for you. 
* Need to make a tough decision? Flip a coin!
* Exercising? Generate a random number of sit-ups to do!
* Bored and have hours to kill? Try to guess the next random number!

All these exclusive features could be yours for the low, low price of $0.00!

In all seriousness, this is just an app to help me learn Android development. Enjoy!
